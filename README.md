# PyLiLa
Python interface to access the [LiLa Knowledge Base](https://lila-erc.eu/).

## How to use it

For the present, I have a couple of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/francescomambrini/PyLiLa/tree/master/examples) 
to illustrate how the code is supposed to work.

## How to install

At the moment, just clone the repo and add the project 
root to your `PYTHONPATH`.
