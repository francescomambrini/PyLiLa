    "[LiLa](https://lila-erc.eu/) is a collection of linguistic resources for Latin published using Semantic Web standards and interconnected according to the [Linked-Open-Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "LiLa brings corpora, lexicons and NLP tools together. The guiding priciple of LiLa's architecture is simple:\n",
    "* lexicons describe *words* (technically, entries, which can be multi-word expressions)\n",
    "* corpora and digital texts are made of tokens, which are *occurrences of words*\n",
    "* NLP tools process tokens; they're often connected in pipelines which often include Lemmatization (see below) as one of the first steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process that brings them together is the NLP task known as [Lemmatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation). For a morphologically rich language like Latin, this task means reducing the forms of the inflectional paradigm of a word to a base form, conventionally chosen to be the citation form. E.g. the form *rosas* (accusative plural of a 1st-stem noun) is reconducted to the nominative singular *rosa*. This is also the form that you would use to look the word up in a dicitionary. That is to say: the *lemma* is also the form used by lexicons to index lexical entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, the lemma form is the perfect point for the 3 types of resources to meet, because:\n",
    "* entries in lexicons are indexed using lemmas;\n",
    "* corpus tokens can be lemmatized, i.e. tokens can be associated to lemmas;\n",
    "* Lemmatizers output lemmatized texts (i.e. texts where tokens are associated to their lemmas)"

    "\n",
    "Currently the Lemma Bank include about 200k forms distinguished in two classes:\n",
    "* Lemmas: the ordinary forms used to lemmatize.\n",
    "* Hypolemmas: a sub-class of the general Lemma class used for potentially ambigous cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get what Hypolemmas are, consider a couple of sample English examples. Would you lemmatize the form *quickly* under the adverb *quickly* or the adjective *quick*? The superlative *best* under *best* or under *good*? *Flying* (as in *flying machine*) as the adj. *flying* or the verb *fly*. Each of those solutions would make sense, and we don't know *a priori* which decision the builders of the corpora or the lexicons that we want to link have decided to adopt.\n",
